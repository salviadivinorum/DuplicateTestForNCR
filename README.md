# DuplicateTestForNCR
Testing 2 sets of integers for duplicity

It means compare them if they are equal, no matter in what order they are sorted.
It took me about 10hours to complete the tasks, incl. Unit Tests with random data input in test.txt file.
Time Complexity of my solution is O(log n).
The required DuplicateSets.dll library is in DuplicateSets/bin/debug sub-folder.

See you, David, Jeseník
