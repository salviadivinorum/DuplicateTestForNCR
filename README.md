# DuplicateTestForNCR
Testing 2 sets of integers for duplicity

It means compare them if they are equal, no matter in what order they are sorted.
It took me about 10hours to complete the tasks, incl. UNIT TESTS with random data input in test.txt file.
Time Complexity of my solution is O(log n).
Code of the required library is in DuplicateSets sub-folder.

IDE: MS Visual Studio 2015, .NET Framework 4.5.2, Visual C#

See you, David, Jesen√≠k

PS: No mercy for clueless quantum abstraction. I have failed to pass the above NCR exam.
